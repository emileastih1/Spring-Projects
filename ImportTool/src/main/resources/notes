First we create our packages :
-controllers (this will hold our API controllers)
-models (our JPA entities and other persistance information)
-repositories (DAL: data access layer, our JPA repositories)
-services ( that will hold our business logic or service based code)

Second we will create our repositories:
-Normally our repositories are interfaces
-They are too easy to set up
-Once our JPA Interfaces are set up, we now have the basic delete , insert and update and bunch of other stuff directly available to us

Thirdly we will create our controllers:
-You can think about controllers as the servlets
-For this demo they will be rest based
